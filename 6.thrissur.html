    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/thrissur/4-athirapally waterfalls.jfif" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para">On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

      The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India</div>

    <h1>02 Shakthan Thampuran Palacel</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/thrissur/2.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin.

      In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a travellerâ€™s dream.</p></div>

    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/alappuzha/3. Backwaters of Kuttanad.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>The oxygen jar of the city of Thrissur, Vilangan Kunnu is a hillock located near the city. From its top, one can get a fine view of the Thrissur city and Thrissur Kole Wetlands, making the place one of the most favourite picnic spots in the region.

      Simply surreal, the experience from the 5-acre hilltop is only enhanced by the construction of an amusement park, where there are a number of rides that the kids can enjoy with the amazing view below.</p></div>

    <h1>4. Dolours Basilica</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/thrissur/4.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>The Dolours Basilica, or the Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours (as the full name goes), is a distinct building in the city of Thrissur. You can easily recognize this grand church from its white facade.

      Smack in the middle of a lush green valley, this basilica is known for narrating quite a number of stories of love and faith. Spread in an area of about 25,000 sq feet, Dolours Basilica is the third tallest church in Asia and the largest church in the country with double storeyed aisles.</p></div>
