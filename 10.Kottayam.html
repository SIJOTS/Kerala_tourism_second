    <h1>ILAVEEZHAPOONCHIRA</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/kottayam/1.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para">Ilaveezha poonchira, a hill station near Melukavu Mattom, 60kms from Kottayam is gaining tourist importance.
      Located among three beautiful hillocks Mankunnu, Kudayathoormala and Thonippara, Poonchira is a place of picturesque charm. Legends say that the pool here was a bathing place for Panchali the legendary heroine of Mahabharata. The D.T.P.C. is developing this place into a trekking spot. A tourist bungalow with rooms and dormitory to accommodate 15 people has been constructed. The beautiful valleys of Poonchira are spread across thousands of acres. The verdant landscape punctuated by the gigantic hills, each rising to around 3200 ft. is an ideal place to unwind. During the monsoons when the valley fills up to form a scenic lake, this place unveils yet another beautiful slice of nature. Ilaveezha poonchira means valley where leaves donâ€™t fall and is named so because the place has no trees. This is also one of the best places in Kerala to witness both the sun rise and sunset..</div>

However the most fascinating thing here is the Chuttuvilakku (row of lamps) carved out on the stonewalls of the Sastha Temple nearby. Such rocks cut lamps are rare in India..</p></div>
