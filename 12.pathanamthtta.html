    <h1>1. Pandalam Palace</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/pathanamthitha/1.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para">The Pandalam family was an off-shoot of the mighty Pandya dynasty, and in spite of being a small faction, commanded great wealth and respect in what is now modern Kerala, albeit thousands of years ago. The Pandalam Palace is maintained in their memory and contains mixed influences of Pandya and Malabar architecture. The Palace is considered the childhood home of Lord Ayyappa, and is one of the foremost Pathanamthitta tourist places.

      Top tip - There are a lot of strict rules you need to follow if you want to visit the Pandalam Palace, so consult someone from the local tourism board..</div>

    <h1>2. Aranmula</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/pathanamthitha/2.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Aranmula, a UN heritage site, is famous for two things - the boat race and the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. Then, you can also buy an Aranmula Kannadi, an intricately-designed metal mirror made using a secret method that’s been passed down from over generations. It’s said to have a healing influence. Next, try and plan your trip during the Vallasadya, which is a huge 70-item feast celebrating the bravery and physical might of the oarsmen who participate in the boat festival. There’s always another story around the corner in Aranmula, making it one of the best places to visit in Pathanamthitta. If you want to get in on the snake boat race, it’s best to make your bookings in advance at one of the many heritage lodges available in the area.

    <h1>3. Thriveni Sangamam</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/pathanamthitha/3.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Hindus believe that rivers originating from holy places have a cleansing effect, and a dip in one will erase all the sins in the past. Now, that depends on how much of a believer you are, but at Thriveni Sangamam, there’s one thing for sure - it’s one of the most breathtaking places to visit in Pathanamthitta. It is a confluence of three rivers - the Pamba River Manimala River and the Achankovil River, all deeply connected with Sabarimala. A dip into the refreshing waters will definitely wipe away your tiredness, and maybe, a few sins here and there. Top tip - Carry your own food and keep your belongings close, as pickpockets are quite common.</p></div>

    <h1>4. Konni Forest Reserve</h1>
    <div class="img"><img alt="Qries" src="./img/pathanamthitha/4.jpg" width=150" height="70"></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Yes, most tour guides will swear by a visit to Sabarimala, but it’s off the beaten path that you find real treasure. Pathanamathitta, a jungle kingdom, beckons the young and the old. As long as you’re mindful of the local traditions and don’t litter the place, you will be fine. It’s the same as other tourist places, we guess. Flights to Pathanamathitta are generally overbooked in November and December because the Sabarimala temple is open during this period. But you can also plan a visit sometime just before the peak season, and that is in September or October. It’s when the monsoons wear off and the place starts to cool down, since winter season from November to February. You will need a local guide, which many top hotels will be able to organise for you. Additionally, carry good shoes since you’ll have to walk around a lot. For more such detailed travel-related information, visit intermiles.com. Did you know that you could also book flights for yourself and earn InterMiles?

      Simply remember to quote your InterMiles membership number. You can redeem your miles for free flights, hotel stays, fuel and over 2500+ merchandise options on the InterMiles Reward Store.
